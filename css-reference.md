# CSS Reference #
## Landing Page - CSS ##
Use CSS to style your page

1. Margin and Padding 
- Read this article: [Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp)
- __margin__ Controls how far apart html elements are from each
- __padding__ Controls how far apart html elements are from their internal edges
- This is often referred to as the "Box Model" 

2. Font
- Read this article: [CSS Font](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp)
- __font-family__ Sets the font (typeface) of an element...only fonts on the user's computer can be used though. So, just becuase it looks right on your computer does not mean it will look right on someone else's. This is why the w3schools recommends using only basic typefaces (we will learn a way to overcome this limitation)
- __font-size__ Sets the size of the font

3. Color
- Read this article: [CSS Color](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_color.asp)
- __color__ Can change the color of text

4. Div
- A __div__ is a "division" in a page. Use it to wrap a bunch of elements that you want to keep together. In a div you can set width and height and background color. 
- Here is an example of formatting you can use with your landing page: [Landing page on codepen](https://codepen.io/jasonleecooksey/pen/YrBZMo?editors=1100)
